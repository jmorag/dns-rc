This is a basic test! Its not doing anything tricky; it should work if your DNS
server is ready to handle recursive requests.

You can run it with `run_test.sh`, which takes two arguments: the hostname for
your server, and the port it is running on. For instance, `run_test.sh localhost
5353` will run this test against a DNS server running on 5353.
